## This is backend source for my example project of auth with technologies: React, Node, Express, SQLite.

For build and run this project needs to create the .env file, it has to have "TOKEN_SECRET_WORD" variable with anything value or add this variable to "Environment" (for deploy). "jsonwebtoken" library uses it which generates token for frontend auth.
